    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of depression among individuals based on various features such as demographic information, academic and work-related pressures, lifestyle habits, and family history of mental illness. The dataset used for this project is sourced from a Kaggle challenge and contains multiple features that are indicative of an individual's mental health status.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the dataset to make it suitable for training machine learning models. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.\n",
    "2. **Model Development**: Develop a neural network model using PyTorch to predict the likelihood of depression. The model will be trained on a subset of the data and validated on another subset to evaluate its performance.\n",
    "3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, loss, and validation accuracy. Fine-tune the model to improve its performance.\n",
    "4. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to make predictions on a separate test dataset and save the results for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gender**: Gender of the individual (encoded as integers).\n",
    "- **Age**: Age of the individual.\n",
    "- **City**: City of residence (encoded as integers).\n",
    "- **Working Professional or Student**: Whether the individual is a working professional or a student (encoded as integers).\n",
    "- **Profession**: Profession of the individual (encoded as integers).\n",
    "- **Academic Pressure**: Level of academic pressure experienced by the individual.\n",
    "- **Work Pressure**: Level of work pressure experienced by the individual.\n",
    "- **CGPA**: Cumulative Grade Point Average (for students).\n",
    "- **Study Satisfaction**: Satisfaction level with studies.\n",
    "- **Job Satisfaction**: Satisfaction level with job.\n",
    "- **Sleep Duration**: Average sleep duration.\n",
    "- **Dietary Habits**: Dietary habits (encoded as integers).\n",
    "- **Degree**: Highest degree obtained (encoded as integers).\n",
    "- **Have you ever had suicidal thoughts?**: Whether the individual has ever had suicidal thoughts (encoded as integers).\n",
    "- **Work/Study Hours**: Average number of work or study hours per day.\n",
    "- **Financial Stress**: Level of financial stress experienced by the individual.\n",
    "- **Family History of Mental Illness**: Whether there is a family history of mental illness (encoded as integers).\n",
    "- **Depression**: Target variable indicating whether the individual is experiencing depression (binary).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this project, we aim to have a well-trained neural network model that can accurately predict the likelihood of depression based on the provided features. The model's predictions will be saved and can be used for further analysis or interventions to support mental health initiatives."
